# MiniMat3

There are 4 data sets in the attached .mat file. All of them are 2-d and labeled.

Implement a Gaussian generative model classifier, and a logistic regression classifier. Both of your classifiers must be LINEAR, and perform their classification using only linear sums of the input arguments. i.e., no evaluating the Gaussian pdf.

Quiz on Monday on linear classifiers.

Also, by this Thursday, send me an email proposing a final project.
